# Welcome to the HAL 9001 Quickstart Guide!

HAL9001 is a hardware abstraction layer (H.A.L.) created to make programming in FTC faster, cleaner and more collaborative, as well as provide some extra functionality on top of the normal FTC app api. This website contains a set of tutorials meant to get you more familiar with how HAL works, starting with its most fundamental features and eventually branching off into more complex ones.

So, lets get started! If you are new to HAL, click [here](_dropdown/installation.md) to begin the quickstart guide. If you are here to learn a specific HAL feature, simply select your desired feature from the table of contents (or the dropdown menu), and start learning. Have fun!
